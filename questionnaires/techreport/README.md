# A Questionnaire to Assess Virtual Conference Participation Experience

This technical report describes the preliminary design of a questionnaire to assess the participants experience of virtual conferences, compared to classical on-site conferences. The survey approach con- sists of a pre-conference questionnaire assessing participation goals and a post-conference questionnaire assessing the participation experience. It enables a data-driven investigation of the participantâ€™s experience, goals, and general feedback about virtual conferences. Beyond its original goal of assessing virtual conferences, the questionnaire enables to assess goals of conference participation. The questionnaire was successfully used at one conference and two workshop. It is released early to foster research on virtual conferences.
