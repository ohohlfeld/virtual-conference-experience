","Use slack for Q&A after presentations because of the ability to follow threads. A open-discussion Zoom session. Talks/slides are published after they are streamed to have the ability to rewind some points. Have a speed-dating session for participants in which each participant should make a 5-min call with a random subset of other participants to re-enforce the social aspect."

On a side note, the committee could also give people -- except paper authors -- who can only attend a day or half day, a pay-as-you-go option, i.e. the possibility to pay only for the period they are only available for. "
