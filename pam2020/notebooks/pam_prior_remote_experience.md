## Personal details

We first would like to learn few personal details about you to be able
to better interpret your answers in this questionnaire.

Note that these questions are the same as in the pre-conference
questionnaire since we cannot correlate both questionnaires due to
anonymity.

## Social Interactions (Virtual Hallway Track)

conferences are about general interactions with known and new
researchers (e.g., during breaks or at the dinner table): the hallway
track. We are interested in this section how you experienced the hallway
track at
PAM.

### Pros: What worked well about attending remotely

    ## [1] Q&A                                                                                                                                                               
    ## [2] Technically everything was fine                                                                                                                                   
    ## [3] that we could do it at all                                                                                                                                        
    ## [4] Avoiding traveling is a big plus for many reasons (family, financial, practical). Ability to focus on presentations and interact with presenters is *much* better.
    ## 28 Levels: Actual presentations and Q/A. ...

### Cons: What did not work well about attending remotely

    ## [1] Timezone                                                                                                       
    ## [2] Just like seeing videos on youtube...                                                                          
    ## [3] the hallway                                                                                                    
    ## [4] I felt I didn't have the chance to interact with enough people and make new connections, maybe it's me though. 
    ## 28 Levels: Attending sessions was difficult to due time zone differences. However, another issue is that the regular work continues (and seems more important though it perhaps isn't). Being at a venue blocks your agenda and makes your focus on the conference.  ...

### Other comments / suggestions / feedback

    ## [1] Future online conferences should have longer Q&A sections and possible multiple "venues" during the same couple of days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
    ## [2] Organizers did a super job. Itâ€™s just that remote conferences are not ... conferences                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
    ## [3] my sympathies to the organizers.  it came off better than i hoped.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
    ## [4] Use slack for Q&A after presentations because of the ability to follow threads. A open-discussion Zoom session. Talks/slides are published after they are streamed to have the ability to rewind some points. Have a speed-dating session for participants in which each participant should make a 5-min call with a random subset of other participants to re-enforce the social aspect.
