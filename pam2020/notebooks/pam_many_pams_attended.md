## Personal details

We first would like to learn few personal details about you to be able
to better interpret your answers in this questionnaire.

Note that these questions are the same as in the pre-conference
questionnaire since we cannot correlate both questionnaires due to
anonymity.

![](pam_many_pams_attended_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-50-1.png)<!-- -->

### (optional) Pros: What did you like about pre-recorded talks?

    ##  [1] I think it made the talk experience more uniform overall -- even with the variations in audio quality in tone, it was less than you'd usually find in a live, in-person presentation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
    ##  [2]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
    ##  [3] All speakers did very good job of pacing themselves and sticking to time limit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
    ##  [4]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
    ##  [5]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
    ##  [6] there was little presentational quality loss due to nervousness!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
    ##  [7] Well done and all talks were very well timed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
    ##  [8]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
    ##  [9] helped weak speakers a bit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
    ## [10] They were well-prepared and timed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
    ## [11] All authors made sure to give as much as details in their presentations; we can access the videos and go through the talks again when their are made available; It participated to the fact that we did not had any author loosing their connection during the talk; Since the presentation was already pre-recorded, authors can just came in to answer questions and focus on networking or learning about other's work. 
    ## [12]

    ##  [2]                                                                                                                                                                                     
    ##  [3] It was helpful if there was a speaker in the corner. I didn't like the talks that only had slides.                                                                                  
    ##  [4] didn't like those that used computerized speech                                                                                                                                     
    ##  [5]                                                                                                                                                                                     
    ##  [6] The quality of the recorded audio varied a lot. Sometimes it was harder/more energy demanding to listen to the prerecorded talk than it might have been during an in-person meeting.
    ##  [7] Most of the pre-recorded talks were well done. Some, however, experienced bad audio quality (probably from using built-in Laptop mic instead of external headset).                  
    ##  [8]                                                                                                                                                                                     
    ##  [9] that one robotic one was horrifying                                                                                                                                                 
    ## [10]                                                                                                                                                                                     
    ## [11] The amount of time and work it requires for authors to prepare them.                                                                                                                
    ## [12]

### (optional): Pros: Other feedback on *positive* aspects of the ability to interact during this virtual conference

    ##  [1] I think the interactions were much easier -- digital communication is often significantly easier (which comes with its own challenges, especially concerning inadvertent tone, etc.), so I think it made it easier for a wider set to ask questions, and also created a slightly less stressful opportunity for authors to respond (especially compared to standing on a stage).
    ##  [2]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
    ##  [3] It worked better than I expected.

    ##  [6] slack facilitates getting into contact.

    ##  [9] i am used to zoom and slack, so those were easy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
    ## [10] Didn't have "stage fright" when asking questions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
    ## [11] Attending the virtual conference allowed us to continue our main routine/be working/having calls in between or post-sessions. I also followed the talks better and if we could have the videos to go through them at will later, that would be even better.

### (optional): Cons: Other feedback on *negative* aspects of the ability to interact during this virtual conference

    ##  [1] I think this may have scaling challenges beyond a setting like PAM. While it worked great here, if there were more questions, the "ask directly in zoom" method may have become untenable.

    ## [11] There is like a virtual barrier when you never met someone and you need to ask questions or discuss for the first time. That barrier was removed by interacting, meeting in person, and the attending the events organised at the unperson conference. That factor (getting to know each other better and have deeper conversations) is what we missed during the virtual conference.

## Social Interactions (Virtual Hallway Track)

Besides content related to technical presentations (papers / posters),
conferences are about general interactions with known and new
researchers (e.g., during breaks or at the dinner table): the hallway
track. We are interested in this section how you experienced the hallway
track at
PAM.

### Did you use Slack or the Zoom chat to interact with others about topics unrelated to the presentations?

### How do you rate the quality of social interactions (unrelated to the presentations) during this virtual conference compared to classical on-site conferences?

Interactions with researchers I already
know

Interactions with new researchers I didnâ€™t know
before

### (optional) What did you enjoy about social interaction at this virtual conference?

    ##  [1] It made some interactions easier: no need to wait for another researcher to not be busy to catch them in a hallway -- you can simply message them asynchronously.

### (optional) How can social interactions be improved at virtual conferences?

    ##  [1] Facilitating some small-group voice communication might be interesting. As an industry participant, there are a number of operational insights I would generally like to share with other researchers that are complicated to do in written virtual settings. This could be mitigated with smaller group audio chats as part of the event (other suddenly-virtual conferences have had some luck with BoF sessions and things of that nature).

Maybe arrange discussion sessions where participants join a zoom session just for open discussion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
    ## [11] We could also organize a virtual dinner, with the possibility to have breakout zoom rooms where a couple of people could discuss about topics of interests or future collaborations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
    ## [12]

### Pros: What worked well about attending remotely

    ##  [1] Easy to tune in  -- especially as it matched my timezone.                                                                                                                                     
    ##  [2] The presentations                                                                                                                                                                             
    ##  [3] I was able to attend on my own schedule from home. Sound and video were good, as well as  interactions with speakers.                                                                         
    ##  [4] easier to attend                                                                                                                                                                              
    ##  [5] Technically everything was fine                                                                                                                                                               
    ##  [6] no travel cost (as in time and money)                                                                                                                                                         
    ##  [7] The video conferencing system worked quite well.                                                                                                                                              
    ##  [8] Easy to fit to my schedule                                                                                                                                                                    
    ##  [9] that we could do it at all                                                                                                                                                                    
    ## [10] Avoiding traveling is a big plus for many reasons (family, financial, practical). Ability to focus on presentations and interact with presenters is *much* better.                            
    ## [11] Better focus on technical content, possibility to continue working in between sessions and focus on other activities post-sessions, improvement of the quality and the details in the talks,  
    ## [12] No travel - better both for day-to-day and for lockdown!

### Cons: What did not work well about attending remotely

    ##  [1] The audience definitely seemed to skew time-zone local - PAM regulars from Europe and Asia seemed to be missing -- ie we can expect people to reset their personal clocks for travel, but not for a virtual conference (especially with other factors). 
    ##  [2] The social interactions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
    ##  [3] nothing, I didn't have any problems                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
    ##  [4] social interaction with colleagues                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
    ##  [5] Just like seeing videos on youtube...                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
    ##  [6] the last talks were in the early morning hours in my time. I was lucky to get a slot with manageable time constraints for presenting.                                                                                                                   
    ##  [7] Timezone differences, lack of hallway discussions                                                                                                                                                                                                       
    ##  [8] Interaction with other researchers                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
    ##  [9] the hallway                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
    ## [10] I felt I didn't have the chance to interact with enough people and make new connections, maybe it's me though.                                                                                                                                          
    ## [11] Increase of the amount of the information to parse from each presentation, less social interactions, less discussions with other members of the community, etc.                                                                                         
    ## [12] Some distractions from family, as conference in evening for my time zone.                                                                                                                                                                               
    ## 28 Levels: Attending sessions was difficult to due time zone differences. However, another issue is that the regular work continues (and seems more important though it perhaps isn't). Being at a venue blocks your agenda and makes your focus on the conference.  ...

    ##  [5] Organizers did a super job. Itâ€™s just that remote conferences are not ... conferences                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
    ##  [6] You did a great job! thanks for making this a success!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
    ##  [7] Great work, organizers and chairs!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
    ##  [8]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
    ##  [9] my sympathies to the organizers.  it came off better than i hoped.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
    ## [10] Use slack for Q&A after presentations because of the ability to follow threads. A open-discussion Zoom session. Talks/slides are published after they are streamed to have the ability to rewind some points. Have a speed-dating session for participants in which each participant should make a 5-min call with a random subset of other participants to re-enforce the social aspect.
    ## [11] I believe some (top) conferences can have both the virtual and the in-person version in the future, while others can only adopt the virtual version.  \nOn a side note, the committee could also give people -- except paper authors -- who can only attend a day or half day, a pay-as-you-go option, i.e. the possibility to pay only for the period they are only available for.      
    ## [12] I really enjoyed it, and would definitely do it again.
