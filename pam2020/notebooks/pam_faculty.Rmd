```{r include = FALSE}
source("init.R")
preconf <- preconf[c(which(preconf$seniority == "Faculty"), which(preconf$seniority == "Postdoc")),]
postconf <- postconf[c(which(postconf$seniority == "Faculty"), which(preconf$seniority == "Postdoc")),]
```

This document contains results to the PAM 2020 questionnaires by *faculty participants* only.
We define industry as a combination of "Faculty" and "Postdoc" since they potentially share the same objectives in attending.

```{r, child=c('pam_base_preconf.Rmd', 'pam_base_postconf.Rmd')}
