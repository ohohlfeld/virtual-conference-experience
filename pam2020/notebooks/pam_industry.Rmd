```{r include = FALSE}
source("init.R")
preconf <- preconf[c(which(preconf$seniority == "Industry"), which(preconf$seniority == "government scientist")),]
postconf <- postconf[c(which(postconf$seniority == "Industry"), which(postconf$seniority == "government scientist")),]
```

This document contains results to the PAM 2020 questionnaires by *industry participants* only.
We define industry as a combination of "Industry" and "government scientist" since they potentially share the same objectives in attending.

```{r, child=c('pam_base_preconf.Rmd', 'pam_base_postconf.Rmd')}
