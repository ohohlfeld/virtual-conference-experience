## Group by Objectives

We define the first groups by their shared objectives in attending PAM.

  - [Industry](pam_industry.md): (“Industry” and “government scientist”)
      - 9 responses pre-conf, 6 post-conf — a bit too few to draw solid
        conclusions
  - [Faculty](pam_faculty.md): (“Faculty” and “Postdoc”)
      - 9 responses pre-conf, 9 post-conf —
  - [Students](pam_students.md): (“PhD student” and “Master student” /
    undergrad)
      - 13 responses pre-conf, 12 post-conf — ok

## Group by Overall Experience

  - Users with a [Poor](pam_poor_experience.md)
      - 6 post-conf — very few (good for the conf ;)
  - [Good](pam_good_experience.md) overall experience.
      - 22 responses pre-conf — quite solid

## Group by the number of PAMs attended

  - Users who attended their [first](pam_1st_time_attendee.md) time and
      - 21 responses pre-conf, 16 post-conf — quite solid
  - [more than once](pam_many_pams_attended.md).
      - 10 responses pre-conf, 12 post-conf — ok

## Group by their willingness to come to attend PAM in-person

  - Users who [would have attended PAM in Oregon](pam_oregon-yes.md) and
      - 19 responses pre-conf, 20 post-conf — quite solid
  - [would *not* have attended PAM in Oregon](pam_oregon-no.md).
      - 12 responses pre-conf, 8 post-conf — might be ok

## Group by prior remote conference experience

  - [Responses by users with no prior remote conference
    experience](pam_no_prior_remote_experience.md)
